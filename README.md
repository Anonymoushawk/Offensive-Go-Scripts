# Offensive Go
I'll personally use this repo as a point of reference if ever I forget go basics. Anything `golang` related that I make and learn will end up here.     


### My Scripts 
- [OnlineHost](https://github.com/OlivierLaflamme/Pentesting_GoLang/blob/master/OnlineHost/main.go) => Uses Go net/http library to distinguish alive hosts from a give list of hosts/urls    
- [findIDHash](https://github.com/OlivierLaflamme/Pentesting_GoLang/blob/master/findIDHash/findIDHash.go) => Takes a hash, calculates the length, and compares the length against hashcat's generic hash types
